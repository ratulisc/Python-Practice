    <h1>Iceland</h1>
    <p>
        The capital, Reykjavik, <br> is also 
        characterized by some of the prettiest 
        places in Iceland, including Harpa, a 
        glass-sided waterfront concert hall; 
        Hallgrimskirkja, a soaring modernist 
        church, and attractive lanes crammed 
        with colorful street art.Iceland might 
        offer some of the worldâ€™s most beautiful 
        landscapes, but the country is fairly 
        compact and smaller than the state of 
        New York. There are few roads, though, 
        and the fjord-indented coastline spans 
        3,000 miles, so plan your visit carefully
        to take in as much as possible of this 
        extraordinary country.
