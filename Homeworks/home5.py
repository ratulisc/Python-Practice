"""

You are given a binary number . Now  convert it to decimal number .


1. Take input as a string
2. store the length of the string in a variable
3. now run a loop and take digit one by one and multiply them with 2^(length-(i+1))
4. calculate all the sum and print it



Give at least a try of 3 hour.
Don't take help from any online source by any mean



s[0] -> string 1 -> int 1 -> 1*2^(len-1)
0*2^(3)
1*2^2
0*2^1
1*2
