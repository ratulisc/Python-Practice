The Hilarious  there should be a line break to create spacing between rows.
Your program shNumber Pattern

Write a Python program that generates a hilarious number pattern using nested for loops. The program should prompt the user
for the number of rows in the pattern and display the pattern accordingly. Each row of the pattern will contain numbers
based on a specific rule.

Here's how the pattern should be generated:

The user will input the number of rows in the pattern.
The pattern starts with the number 1 and increases by 1 for each subsequent row.
Within each row, the number will be repeated the same number of times as the row number. For example, in the 3rd row, the
number will be repeated 3 times.
After each row,ould have the following features:

Prompt the user to enter the number of rows in the pattern.
Use nested for loops to generate the number pattern according to the specified number of rows.
Print each row of the pattern with the numbers formatted as described above.
After the pattern is generated, print a message indicating that the hilarious number pattern is complete.
Note: You can assume that the user will input a positive integer value for the number of rows.
