Problem: Counting Laughter

Write a Python program that counts and displays laughter based on boolean conditions.

You need to implement a function called count_laughter() that takes no arguments and prints laughter based on the following conditions:

If a person is happy (represented by a boolean variable is_happy), they laugh by saying "Haha!"

If a person is very happy (represented by a boolean variable is_very_happy), they laugh louder by saying "Hahahaha!"

If a person is extremely happy (represented by a boolean variable is_extremely_happy), they have a contagious laughter and laugh even louder by saying "Hahahahahaha!"

Your function should use a loop and boolean variables to simulate different levels of happiness and laughter.
